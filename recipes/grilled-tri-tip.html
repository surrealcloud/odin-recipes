    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tri-tip steaks are known for being incredibly flavourful without costing an arm and a leg. With excellent marbling, tri-tip steaks are easily able to compete
        against more expensive steaks in flavour. They are often grilled, but can also be cooked on a hot skillet.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds tri-tip roast</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup black pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup garlic salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the roast; insert garlic slices into the slits.</li>
        <li>Mix salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl; rub all over the tri-tip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before grilling.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place the meat directly above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the juices, about 5 to 10 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Turn the grill down to medium heat and continue to cook, turning occasionally, for another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
